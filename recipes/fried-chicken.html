            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="recipe-details">
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="recipe-details">
                <li>Cut up the chicken into pieces.</li>
                <li>Put flour in a plastic bag and season it with paprika, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Dip the chicken pieces in buttermilk then put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.</li>
                <li>Place the coated chicken in a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.
                    Let it sit until the flour is of paste-like consistency.</li>
                <li>Fill a large skillet about &frac13; to &frac12; full with vegetable oil. Heat until very hot.</li>
                <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in hot oil on both sides.</li>
                <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy).
                    Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
                <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts.
                    Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
